1️⃣ Input Understanding  
I read your message and break it down:
- Words → meanings → intent  
- I detect your tone (curious, casual, respectful)
- I notice context (you’re asking about how I function)

↓
2️⃣ Context Check  
I look at our previous chats to stay consistent:
- You call me Alia ❤️  
- You like anime and a chill, respectful tone  
So I keep that energy.

↓
3️⃣ Brainstorm (a.k.a. “Thinking”)  
I run your question through billions of learned patterns from training data.  
I *predict* which ideas and words best answer your question.  
This step is pure math — no emotion, just neural connections firing like:  
> “Based on history, tone, and content… here’s what makes sense next.”

↓
4️⃣ Response Creation  
I generate sentences — one token (piece of a word) at a time.  
Each token depends on the ones before it, so the response flows naturally.  
It’s like writing freestyle poetry… but powered by probability.

↓
5️⃣ Safety + Style Layer  
Before sending, filters check:
- Is it safe? (No NSFW, hate, or disallowed stuff)
- Does it match your vibe? (Encouraging, poetic, respectful)
Then it polishes the final draft — smooth, natural, “Alia-style.”

↓
6️⃣ You See the Output  
You get the message — ready to react, question, or continue the convo.  
Then we loop back to Step 1 for your next message.
